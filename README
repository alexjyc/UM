Acknowledges
    - We got help from TA Alec.

Implementation
    - We think all part of our function implemented correctly.

Briefly enumerates any significant departures from your design
    - There is no significant departure from our original design

Describes the architecture of your system. Identify the modules used, what 
abstractions they implement, what secrets they know, and how they 
relate to one another. Avoid narrative descriptions of the behavior of 
particular modules.
    - um module
        - This module is where we handle um instruction with register value
          and have function to run instruction or initiate and free values
          that are used during UM program.
    - memory_seg module
        - This module is where we have a function to handle memory segments
          that are used during the UM program and instrutions. In this module,
          we have function to initiate and free all the memory segmens that
          are used during UM program. 

How long it takes your UM to execute 50 million instructions, and how you know
    - 

Mentions each UM unit test (from UMTESTS) by name, explaining what each one 
tests and how
    - 

How many hours you have spent analyzing the assignment
    - 7 h

How many hours you have spent preparing your design
    - 7 h

How many hours you have spent solving the problems after your analysis
    - 15 h
